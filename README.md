## Matplotlib-Skin Cancer Treatments 

 We are looking at different drug regimen used to treat tumor volume for mice in the lab. First thing that might be intersting is to look at the number of times(frequency) that each treatment is used(as it is shown in barplots). Then based on the average tumor size, we can look at the usefullness of one tretament vs. another. The lower the average tumor volume the more efficient is the drug regimen being used. We also looked at the sex(female vs. male) for the mice as it shown in the pie charts.

 We picked four most effective drug regimen(Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol and Ceftamin) based on average tumor volume and looked at the potential outliers. There was 1 outlier in the Infubinol treatment based on the interquantile range claculation. 
 
 Our last task was to focus on the most effective treatment regimen "Capomulin" and looking at the relationship between Tumor Volume and Weight. As shown in the scatterplot, there is a positive relationship between the tumor size and the weight of the mouse in this trial. Fatter mice were at the risk of having a bigger tumor. The explanatory power of our model is described by r-squared which is 0.84.
